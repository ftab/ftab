### Hi guys ðŸ‘‹ How's it hangin?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on audio systems and games
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning LVGL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on in-vehicle infotainment (IVI)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Minecraft modding
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ESP32, embedded systems, audio DSP, Qt, Android Automotive, custom embedded Linux builds, mobile app development, DevOps, GitLab (self-hosting, CI/CD, administration, all the things), Raspberry Pi, Kubernetes. No, that wasn't a tag spam just to show up in all the SEO, I've just had my hand in a lot of cookie jars.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: fury on Libera.chat; fury on Twitter; ftab on GitHub and GitLab
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ—£ Pronunciation: "eff tab" is the canonical pronunciation, but I'm cool with whatever. I've heard eff tee ay bee, fuh-tab, ftab pronounced like stab but with an f instead of an s... Can you come up with one I haven't heard before? 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a jackass of all trades, master of none
