### Hi guys 👋 How's it hangin?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on audio systems and games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Automotive Audio Bus (A2B) and large language models (LLM)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on in-vehicle infotainment (IVI)
- 💬 Ask me about ESP32, embedded systems, audio DSP, Qt, Android Automotive, custom embedded Linux builds, mobile app development, DevOps, GitLab (self-hosting, CI/CD, administration, all the things), Raspberry Pi, Kubernetes
- 📫 How to reach me: fury on Libera.chat; fury on Twitter; ftab on GitHub and GitLab
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🗣 Pronunciation: "eff tab" is the canonical pronunciation, but I'm cool with whatever. I've heard eff tee ay bee, fuh-tab, ftab pronounced like stab but with an f instead of an s... Can you come up with one I haven't heard before? 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a jackass of all trades, master of none
